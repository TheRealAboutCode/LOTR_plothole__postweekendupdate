# POST WEEKEND UPDATE

1. AboutCode had its own "round table conference", much like the Council of Elrond. Below are the Recommendations of the
Round-Table.

2. We are now fairly certain that we are being trolled (One of us has said that we are being "trolled pretty massively", 
but that is a minority opinion) on reddit.

(-) The nature of some of the comments (to paraphrase one of them - "you cannot find loopholes in a book using optimization", 
"you are not communicating well", et cetera) do not seem to be from a place of constructive criticism. It is fairly clear
that these people are trolling our posts.

(-) There is no reason to believe that the trolling won't continue as long as the discussion is only on reddit. In fact, given
that we have said negative things about Trump, Putin, certain professors at Berkeley, America's role in the post World
War II world, et cetera, there's reason to believe that /u/AboutCode will be trolled as long as it is around.

(-) The only alternative option, then, is to expand the space of discussion beyond reddit.

3. We are, of course, fairly certain that there is a plot-hole. What's baffling is why there continues to be a 
committed opposition to this idea - other than the fact that everybody is doing 10 minutes of reading on Quora,
and calling themselves Masters of the subject at hand. This needs to stop.

4. Our first instinct was to abandon this discussion entirely. However, in view of the fact that there are other ideas
we want to discuss, we are going to give people who are still interested a chance to tell us what -their- remaining counter-
-arguments are. In fact, the other ideas we want to discuss are far more important - example: how to stop the government
shutdown, et cetera.

5. We will upload some code to the src directory in a few days. Download the code and run it. (We will have instructions
on how to run the code. Most likely, it will just be some python code, and so you will just need to download 
Python for Windows, Mac or whatever other platform you are using.) 

6. Run the code in the /src directory (not yet created) and then we will talk about next steps.
